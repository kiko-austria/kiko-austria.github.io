    <p>First, I want to be a video editor because my father is a video editor and
        I was amazed at how it is done.
        Then I took an ICT strand in senior high school, where I learned more about computer hardware and software,
        as well as HTML, but only the fundamentals. That's where I want to be a programmer.
        I want to know more about coding, not just in html or CSS, but also in other programming languages,
        and be a computer programmer in the future.</p>
