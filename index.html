    My name is Francis Adriann Fajardo Austria I am 20 years old, 
    and I am currently taking a BSIT with a specialization in Data Science at the Universidad de Manila. 
    I really like having to learn about this course now that I am in my second year, and the more 
    I learn about this course, the more I want from my job in the future.

    Having a web development subject in our course is really a big benefit to us 
    because we may come across this field in our work in the future. 
    Now that we are learning it, it is fun to learn about web development. 
    You can manipulate and create whatever you want to write or input into your website. 
    I really hope to learn more about web development.

I know you'll be back soon, <br>
